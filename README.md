🧵 Python String & Phone Number Analyzer

This Python program takes a user’s full name and phone number as input and performs multiple string operations to analyze, validate, and transform the data.

The goal of this project is to practice Python string methods, input validation, and conditional logic.

📄 File Structure
main.py
README.md

🚀 Features
Name Analysis

Calculates the length of the name

Finds:

First occurrence of 'o'

First and last occurrence of 'h'

Converts the name to:

Uppercase

Lowercase

Capitalized form

Checks whether the name:

Contains digits

Contains only alphabets

Phone Number Analysis

Calculates phone number length

Checks whether the phone number contains only digits

Removes hyphens (-) if present

Counts how many hyphens are used

Validates whether the phone number is entered correctly

🛠️ How It Works

The user enters their full name

The user enters their phone number

The program applies various string methods:

len()

find() / rfind()

upper(), lower(), capitalize()

isdigit(), isalpha()

replace()

count()

Results are printed clearly to the console

▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed

Open a terminal in the project folder

Run:

python main.py

📌 Example Output
Enter your full name: Mohit Jha
Enter your Phone # : 123-456-7890

length of name : 9
length of phone # : 12

Name's capitalize : Mohit jha
Phone Numbe : 1234567890
Name is correctly put
Phone no. is corect
no of '-' in Phone no. 2
